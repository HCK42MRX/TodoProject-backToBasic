# Todo Application with React and Next.js

## Back Story

Recently, I faced some challenges and confusion while working with Next.js. To strengthen my understanding and skills, I decided to revisit the fundamentals of React development. As a result, I developed a Todo application using React along with straightforward hooks. This project served as a valuable learning experience and allowed me to reinforce my knowledge of React and its ecosystem.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Todo application built with React and Next.js. The application provides basic functionalities to manage a list of tasks.

### Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks based on completion status (All, Active, Completed)
- All todo data save in your browser local storage (mungkin akan di update ke simpan di database nanti :) )

### Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **React Hooks**: Use of `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects `useCalback` etc.
